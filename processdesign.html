		<div class="twentyfive">Until recently, Graco used to organize their process by the different stages of a product's development.  For instance, assembly for all products used to take place in one centralized location<br></div>

		<div class="twentyfive">Now, they organize their process by product lines.  This change has made it easier for Graco to manage their cost, quality, and schedule due to the separation of strategic business units.</div>

		<div class="seventyfive" style="height:80vh">
			<ul>
				<li>Graco's Products are Assembled-To-Order.  When they receive a customer order, they already have many completed subassemblies, and only have to add a few customizations to the final product.</li>
				<li>Graco has classified it's products into two main categories: regular and high-priority.  Items are deemed high-priority if they have a profit margin over 20%.  Graco makes every effort to ship these items out in five days or less.</li>
				<li>For regular-priority products, Graco sets a promise delivery date with the customer which can range anywhere between 1 week and 2 months.</li>
				<li>An interesting point the tour guide brought up about Graco's process is that it flows well both ways.  When a customer returns an order, it is swiftly disassembled, the good parts are recycled, and then it is rebuilt and reshipped to the customer.</li>
				<li>Some metrics Graco uses to keep it's process in line are on-time delivery %, lead time, and unit fill rate (for subassemblies, not finished products).</li>
